# OnlineBank-API
Online banking is an integrated part of everyday life for most of us, it saves time and is a very efficient way to do banking anywhere anytime.

Together with my team (3 members) we have built an online banking API using **Java**.

We have designed an Enitity Relationship Diagram to visualise the connections and designed the URIs for all the resources.

We have built the API in NetBeans as a **Maven Web Application** using **Glassfish as a server** with **Jersey and JAX-RS** for annotations. All services accepted HTTP responses in XML or JSON format.

We have then tested all the services using **Postman**.

A basic UI was added in order to be able to run the service inside a browser.
